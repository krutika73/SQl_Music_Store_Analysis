# Problem statment 
This GitHub repository encompasses a detailed SQL analysis of a music store database, addressing fundamental, moderate, and advanced questions. In the foundational set, the queries focus on determining the senior-most employee, identifying countries with the most invoices, finding the top three invoice values, pinpointing the city with the best customers, and determining the customer who spent the most money. The moderate set delves into retrieving information about Rock music listeners, identifying the top 10 rock bands based on track count, and listing tracks longer than the average. The advanced set explores the amount spent by each customer on artists, the most popular music genre by country, and the top spending customer by country.
